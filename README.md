## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to install the latest versions of Node and npm, clone this repository and change into the project directory.
Per requirements, the original data needed some manipulations. You can find the python script, I've used [here](/dataset/prepare_restaurant_data.py).

### Installing

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

## Usage

After starting the server, the application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
